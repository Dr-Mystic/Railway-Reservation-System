# Railway Reservation System for Administration

## Description
This C++ project is a fully functional railway reservation system built for railway administration. It provides the ability to manage train schedules, handle passenger reservations, and store passenger information. The system uses dynamic memory allocation and file handling to simulate a database, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

## Features
- **Train Schedule Management:** Administrators can add, modify, and delete train schedules.
- **Reservation Management:** Allows users to book, cancel, and view reservations for different trains.
- **Passenger Information Management:** Stores and retrieves passenger details, keeping track of reservation statuses.

## Core Concepts
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Efficiently manages the program's data structures in memory, simulating a simple database without the use of a DBMS.
- **File Handling:** Supports persistent storage by reading and writing data to files, allowing the system to retain its state between sessions.
  
This project demonstrates key C++ concepts such as classes, file input/output (I/O), and memory management, making it an excellent example of database simulation and administrative management using object-oriented programming.
