### Railway Reservation System for Administration - Project Overview

This C++ project is a comprehensive railway reservation system designed for railway administration. The system manages essential operations such as scheduling trains, handling reservations, and managing passenger information. 

**Key Features:**
- **Train Schedule Management:** Allows administrators to add, update, and delete train schedules.
- **Reservation Management:** Facilitates booking, canceling, and viewing reservations.
- **Passenger Information Management:** Keeps track of passenger details and reservation statuses.

**Key Data Structures & Techniques:**
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Used to efficiently manage data in the system, simulating a database through the creation and manipulation of data structures in memory.
- **File Handling:** Critical for persistent data storage, ensuring that the system's state is maintained across sessions by reading from and writing to files.

This project showcases fundamental concepts in C++ such as classes, file I/O, and memory management, offering a practical example of how a database can be simulated without a traditional DBMS.
